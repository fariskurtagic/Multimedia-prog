The gardens on his property were the great extravagance of his final years; their upkeep required the services of six full-time gardeners. Monet planted agapanthus a thin, wispy lily plant native to Africa along the banks of his pond as well as several other types of indigenous and imported vegetation, such as wisteria, irises, and bamboo."

The water's surface fills the expansive composition so that conventional clues to the artist's and the viewer's vantage point are eliminated. Monet wished for the paintings to encompass the viewer: in his designs for the Musee de l'Orangerie in Paris, he specified that the Water Lily canvases be displayed on curved walls."

Twenty-five years earlier, in the late 1890s, the footbridge provided the subject of Monet's first series of paintings of his pond at Giverny. While the paintings in the earlier series are more naturalistic in style, the later works feature dense swirls and loose strokes of color that almost obscure the form of the bridge. These later paintings also feature a fiery palette of maroons, rusts, and oranges unique within Monet's body of work."

Van Gogh had moved to Arles in 1888, hoping to create an artists cooperative there. The plan never came to fruition, and the artist became lonely and isolated. He found comfort and companionship with the Roulin family, and they are the subjects of many of his paintings. In this portrait, Roulin is depicted in the uniform he always wore proudly, set against an imaginative backdrop of swirling flowers. In a letter to his brother Theo, the artist wrote that, of all genres, "the modern portrait" excited him the most: 'I want to paint men and women with that something of the eternal which the halo used to symbolize, and which we try to convey by the actual radiance and vibration of 	  our coloring.'" class="btn btn-light">About This Piece</button>

Rooted in imagination and memory,?The Starry Night?embodies an inner, subjective expression of van Gogh's response to nature. In thick, sweeping brushstrokes, a flamelike cypress unites the churning sky and the quiet village below. The village was partly invented, and the church spire evokes van Gogh's native land, the Netherlands."

Later, when the pictures had dried, he sent both of them to Theo in Paris, noting: 'The olive trees with the white cloud and the mountains behind, as well as the rise of the moon and the night effect, are exaggerations from the point of view of the general arrangement; the outlines are accentuated as in some old woodcuts.'"

Here Dali played with the disjunctions between reality and the illusion experienced in the darkness of a movie theater. The imagery, realized through a combination of painting and collage, refers to personal and universal dreams and anxieties. Dali's own disembodied head appears in the middle box, while an allegory of castration anxiety plays out below. Underscoring the experience of motion-picture viewing presented in the painting, this work illustrated the shooting script for Un Chien andalou when it was published in the journal La Revolution surrealiste."
